# About StealthWorm

StealthWorm is more than a team — it’s a student security lab for curious hackers.
Founded at Riphah International University during our 2nd semester, we are a group of hackers from batch 2024, we’re driven by curiosity: not just to win, but to understand and break what others call unbreakable.

## ⚔ Mission

To learn, build, and share practical cybersecurity skills through hands-on CTF challenges. We grow by solving and creating challenges, documenting techniques, and helping fellow students level up.

## 🌟 Vision

To nurture the next generation of CTF players and challenge creators at Riphah. We aim to move from solvers to builders — turning problems into learning tools and sharing that knowledge with our community.

## What we do

- Solve CTF challenges across web, crypto, reversing, and forensics.
- Build small challenge prototypes and write clear walkthroughs.
- Run internal workshops and collaborate on research projects.
- Maintain a friendly learning environment where curiosity leads the way.

## Values

- Learn openly — share knowledge, not just flags.
- Build responsibly — create challenges and tools with care.
- Collaborate — teamwork beats lone hacking.
- Stay curious — questions drive progress.
